hai this file has be create for git merge conflicts



 


Why is Git not allowing me to fast forward merge anymore? If I try to force it using --ff-only, I get the message "fatal: Not possible to fast-forward, aborting." I realize that there are huge advantages to merge --no-ff, but I'm just puzzled why I can't --ff-only now?
